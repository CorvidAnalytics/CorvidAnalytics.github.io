# About Corvid Analytics

Corvid Analytics is a solo business analytics practice based in Minneapolis, MN owned by John Thompson.

I’m a self taught analyst with over a decade of experience working at Fortune 50 companies. My goal is to help medium and small businesses get the most out of their data, without the expense of hiring a full-time business analyst.

I take a tool agnostic approach to analysis answering  the important questions your business has whether it’s a simple report or a predictive model using machine learning.

## What's a "Corvid"?

Crovidae (also known as Corvids) is a family of bird species that includes ravens, crows, jays, and others. These birds are known for their intelligence and mental agility and demonstrate a resourceful approach to problem solving.
